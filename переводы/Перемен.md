### **"Changes!"**

(Эквиритмический перевод песни «Перемен!»)

**[Verse 1]**  
Instead of warmth — glass cold and green,  
Instead of fire — smoke.  
From the grid of the calendar, a day’s torn away.  
The red sun burns to ashes, fades into gray,  
The day dies with its blaze.  
A shadow cloaks the city’s flame.

**[Chorus]**  
Change! Our hearts are demanding,  
Change! Our eyes are commanding.  
In our laughter, tears that follow after,  
In the pulse in our veins —  
Change!  
We await the change!

**[Verse 2]**  
Electric light stretches our day,  
The matchbox is empty, no spark.  
But the gas on the stove burns a blue flower bright,  
Cigarettes in hand, tea on the table tonight.  
This scheme’s simple, stark —  
Nothing’s left outside, it’s all in our heart.

**[Chorus]**  
Change! Our hearts are demanding,  
Change! Our eyes are commanding.  
In our laughter, tears that follow after,  
In the pulse in our veins —  
Change!  
We await the change!

**[Verse 3]**  
We can’t boast wisdom in our eyes,  
Or skilled hands that know all the ways.  
But we don’t need that to read each other’s scars.  
Cigarettes in hand, tea on the table —  
The circle’s closed, it mars.  
Now fear creeps in: to break this chain is hard.

**[Chorus]**  
Change! Our hearts are demanding,  
Change! Our eyes are commanding.  
In our laughter, tears that follow after,  
In the pulse in our veins —  
Change!  
We await the change!
