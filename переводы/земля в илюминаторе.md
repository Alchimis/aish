Earth in the window, Earth in the window,  
Earth in the window, shining bright...  
Like a son misses his mother, like a son misses his mother,  
We miss our Earth — our only light.

And stars, though they’re closer, and stars, though they’re closer,  
Still freeze with their cold, distant glow.  
Like during an eclipse, like during an eclipse,  
We wait for dawn and dream down below.

**Chorus**  
We don’t dream of rockets roaring loud,  
Not the void where blue shadows play.  
But the grass, the grass near our house,  
Green grass, green grass every day.

**Verse 2**  
We carve paths through orbits, through meteors’ storms,  
Where courage and risk are our song.  
The "music of space" in our chatter belongs,  
As we journey where few have gone.

In haze, Earth is glowing — a marble so frail,  
Dawn’s blush and the twilight’s embrace.  
Like a son longs for mother, like a son longs for mother,  
Earth waits for her children in space.

**Chorus** (×2)  
We don’t dream of rockets roaring loud,  
Not the void where blue shadows play.  
But the grass, the grass near our house,  
Green grass, green grass every day.
